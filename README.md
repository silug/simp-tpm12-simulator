## simp-tpm12-simulator


## Description

This project builds and packages newer versions of TPM 1.2 simulator for testing
purposes.  It is a repackage of the upstream IBM's Software TPM 1.2 source code.

### This is a SIMP project

These module is a component of the [System Integrity Management
Platform][simp]
a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, please submit them to our [bug tracker][simp-jira].

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

To build rpm files to install the TPM 1.2 simulator, install this
package and update the configuration files, namely `things_to_build.yaml`
and `simp-tpm12-simulator.spec`, as necessary.  Then build and package
the simulator with the command `bundle exec rake pkg:rpm` from with the
simp-tpm12-simulator directory.

### Beginning with simp-tpm12-simulator

The TPM 1.2 simulator relies upon a couple rpm packages which should be
installed on any target system intended to use the module. The packages are
gcc, the GNU Compiler Collection, and trousers, and implementation of the 
Trusted Computing Group's Software Stack(TSS) specification.  Additionally
tpm-tools, a group of tools to manage and utilize the Trusted Computing
Group's TPM hardware, is recommended.

## Usage

To install the rpm, copy the rpm file to the target system and install it
with the command:

```yaml
yum localinstall simp-tpm12-simulator-*.rpm
```

This will install the simulator programs, utilities, and servics necessary
to start and utilize the TPM 1.2 simulator.

To initialize and use the TPM simulator on EL7, issue the following commands:

```yaml
# systemctl start tpm12-simulator
# systemctl start tpm12-tpmbios
# systemctl restart tpm12-simulator
# systemctl start tpm12-tpmbios
# systemctl start tpm12-tpminit
# systemctl start tpm12-tcsd
```

To initialize and use the TPM simulator on EL6, issue the following commands:

```yaml
# service start tpm12-simulator
# service start tpm12-tpmbios
# service restart tpm12-simulator
# service start tpm12-tpmbios
# service start tpm12-tpminit
# service start tpm12-tcsd
```
